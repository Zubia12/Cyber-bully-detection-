# Cyber-bully-detection-
 A supervised machine learning 
system was developed to detect offensive text messages while targeting the detection of 
cyberbullying through subtle and coded as well as sarcastic messages. In this study we have trained 
and evaluated four different machine learning models using 186,111 messages in English language 
through Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes, Bagging Classifier, Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC) 
and AdaBoost Classifier. Each model operated with CountVectorizer and TF-IDF for feature 
extraction. The optimized Bagging Classifier that used TF-IDF achieved 97.92% accuracy along 
with a F1 score at 97.89% when evaluating performance. This model attained superior reliability 
in recognizing complicated offensive content beyond the capabilities of conventional systems. The 
obtained results exceeded previous research findings in important performance indicators. The 
proposed system demonstrates applications beyond scholarly purposes because it functions well 
as an operational solution too.
